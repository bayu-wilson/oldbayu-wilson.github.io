I followed an online tutorial <a href="http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/"> here</a>. I liked it because of how quickly I could make progress. On the other hand, it was so quick that it makes it hard to absorb the information. My plan is to be persistent and slowly gain a better understanding of html and be more comfortable with it and website design.
